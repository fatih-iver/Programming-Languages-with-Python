# Selecting Substrings : Writing a Python Procedure

# Let p and q each be strings containing two words separated by a space.

# Examples:
#    "bell hooks"
#    "grace hopper"
#    "alonzo church"

# Write a procedure called myfirst_yoursecond(p,q) that returns True if the
# first word in p equals the second word in q. Return False otherwise.

def myfirst_yoursecond(p,q):
    
    return p[:p.find(" ")] == q[q.find(" ") + 1:]

print (myfirst_yoursecond("bell hooks", "curer bell"))
#>>> True
